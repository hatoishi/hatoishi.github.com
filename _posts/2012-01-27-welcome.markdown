This is the blog of me, Jon Doveston.

### Hato-what?

I have assigned myself the alias Hatoishi.  Assuming my surname Doveston started
out as a combination of the words 'dove' and 'stone', I translated this into the
Japanese words 'hato' and 'ishi'. Unfortunately it looses what little geek cool
it has when you realise that the Japanese language does not distinguish between
the dove and the pigeon. Unfortunately I already own the domain.

### Who are you?

I am a small time web developer living in the North of England. The little spare
time I have I spend bringing up my children and practicing martial arts.

### What is it all about?

I expect the posts on my blog will be primarily concerned with programming and
technology.
